Cryptocurrency tethered to the Papua New Guinea Kina (PGK - national currency of Papua New Guinea).

This repo will demonstrate an MVP product with the following capabilities:
- A web form imitating the central bank's ability to issue PGKT, given the matching amount of PGK
- The ability to create a wallet via SMS. The wallet will be permanently associated with the number with which it was created, in order to bring PGKT to Papua New Guinea's unbanked, who have access to mobile phones but little to no internet.
- The ability to check a wallet's balance via SMS (you can only check your own balance)
- The ability to transfer money from your own wallet to another wallet via SMS.
